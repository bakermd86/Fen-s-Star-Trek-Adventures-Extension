## Character Sheet Usage
Most of the basic functionality of Character Sheet controls are going to be fairly obvious to users. 
However, there are some elements of sheet functionality that warrant additional explanation.

### Making Skill Checks

This is the skill rolling area of the character sheet:

To roll a test, just select the attribute and discipline by clicking the fields displaying their scores. A focus can be applied 
by ticking the box next to the focus name. The roll widget in between the Attribute and Discipline lists can be used to 
set a roll difficulty (default is 1) and then you can either double-click or click and drag the blue d20 icon to perform a standard 2d20 roll.

Additionally, once a score is selected, you can also just roll from the normal dice tray and the 
selected attribute, discipline and focus will be applied.
