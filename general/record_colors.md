## Custom LCARS Color Settings

The ruleset allows for custom color schemes to be applied to a number of different record types. The custom colors are set 
on a per-record basis. So each individual character sheet can have its own colors, for example. The record types which allow 
their custom colors to be set are:

 * Character Sheets
 * NPC records
 * Ship records
 * Episode records
 * Senior Staff records

To set the colors, right click on any of the above record types and there is an option to "Edit Colors" which brings up a color 
picker. For example:

![Changing record color schemes](../images/changing_record_colors.gif)

Color selections are stored in the records in the DB, so they will persist across sessions. And each individual record can have 
its own color scheme.

In my games, I have been using it to color-code my NPCs by faction because it reminds me who is who. Players can also find 
themselves with multiple character sheets open due to the use of Supporting Characters. So the ability to set different colors 
can be useful for organization.
