## Fen's Star Trek Adventures Ruleset User and GM Guide

This page is intended to document the features and usage of my Fantasy Grounds Unity ruleset for playing the Modiphius 
Star Trek Adventures 2d20 product (available [here](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/214552/Star-Trek-Adventures-Core-Rulebook)
on DriveThruRPG).

Navigation links on the left will take you to specific documentation pages for the ruleset elements.

### Installation

Like any other Fantasy Grounds ruleset, just place the pak file in the rulesets directory and select the ruleset when 
creating your campaign.
