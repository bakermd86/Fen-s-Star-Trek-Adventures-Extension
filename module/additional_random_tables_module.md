## Additional Random Tables Module

In addition to the core extension features, I packaged together a handful of useful tables that I created into a module that 
integrates to a number of the extension features. That module is available here:

[Random Alien Tables](/module/fen_random_alien_tables.mod)

As with any FG module, just place it in the modules directory.
